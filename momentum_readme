// Todo 
- entering too much trades 
- knowing whether we are in a trade or not /done
- pivot point based risk calculation
- risk to reward should be > 2
- days to trade should be more specific
- close price / atr should be fixed regardless of 1,15,D chart selected on tradingview
- refference above/below pivot should be more specific 
- % closeness to the pivot or something else should be used
